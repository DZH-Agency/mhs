            <p class="guide-blocks-item__note">Note: All of the following NFT rewards will be tradeable on the secondary NFT marketplace once they are claimed with the corresponding Mad Mutant. The claim period will be indefinite, which means once the designated page is published, you can claim your rewards any time you want thanks to Polygon smart contracts.</p>

                  The "Mutant Metamorphosis" cosmetic item can be exclusively attained from the Mad Era mutation event.
                </p>
                  Holders who achieve the coveted Mythical rank will be rewarded with 10 "Mutant Metamorphosis" cosmetic items, Legendary rank will receive five & Epic rank mutants will be granted only one.
                <p></p>
                  To maintain the rarity and exclusivity of the "Mutant Metamorphosis" cosmetic item, only a total of 4,550 will ever be produced. This makes it a genuinely limited-edition cosmetic in the PsychoKitties & Mad Hare Society ecosystem.
                <p></p>
                  If you’ve ever played Runescape, then you will certainly remember tradeable discontinued items such as Party Hats or Santa Hats. Latter appeared randomly on the ground all over RuneScape on 25 December 2002, when players could pick up as many as they wanted. Over time these ultra-rare cosmetics accrued significant value within the culture of the game.
                <p></p>
                  Unlike the Santa Hat, the “Mutant Metamorphosis” cosmetic item will also grant a powerful in-game advantage!

              <h3 class="guide-blocks-item-section__title">Mystery Box</h3>

              <div class="guide-blocks-item-section-text">
                <p>
                  Each Mutant Themed Mystery Box will contain only one of the 12 potential prizes available. The item's rarity determines the likelihood of obtaining it when opening the mystery box.
                </p>
                  There are 7 cosmetic items available, making the chances of obtaining one of these items relatively high. However, there are only two Rare and one Epic cosmetic items, which are more challenging to obtain due to their rarity. Although these items are hard to attain within the game, they are not limited edition, like the “Mutant Metamorphosis” cosmetic item we discussed earlier.
                <p></p>
                  Similarly, four game lobby decorations are available, including one Rare, two Epic, and one Mythical decoration. The probability of obtaining a Mythical decoration is considerably lower than acquiring a Rare decoration.
                <p></p>
                  This feature adds an element of excitement and anticipation to each mystery box. It heightens the sense of surprise and satisfaction when obtaining a unique and exclusive item, which is rare and valuable.
                <p></p>
                  Icing on the cake will be obtaining highly sought-after vouchers for $QTM (Quantum) Tokens - the on-chain cryptocurrency that powers our ecosystem.

                <p>
                  The Mutation event features exclusive consumable SFTs (Semi-Fungible Tokens). There will be five variations of Rare Consumable SFTs and three variations of Secret Consumable SFTs.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These SFTs can only be exclusively claimed by Mad Mutant holders and cannot be produced in the game nor purchased from in-game marketplace. However, you will still be able to sell them on the secondary marketplace to other players. By consuming these SFTs before or during a run, players will receive unique and exclusive properties that give them a distinct game advantage. Once used, they are burned forever.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These SFTs hold exclusive properties that offer a unique effect that surpasses those that can be crafted or purchased within the game. This gives players a rare and special advantage that cannot be obtained elsewhere.

It is harder to obtain, requiring players to invest significant time or purchase it with FIAT for web2 players or $QTM tokens for web3 crypto-savvy players. This currency can be earned through gameplay or bought from the Store, acting as a crucial element in the in-game economy.</p>

                previous Mad Hare rarity score + points from applied upgrade packs = mutant score

There will be a designated "Reward Claim" page opened before game launch where holders can claim their rewards. Until then, all mutants will be traded on the secondary marketplace as if they had the claimable rewards attached to them. This will surely create an interesting valuation dynamic between the ranking and associated rewards & give new holders attracted during our game marketing campaigns the ability to buy those rewards to get a headstart in our upcoming Quantum Frenzy game.
