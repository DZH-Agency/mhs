        <p>Let's say that you have Mad Hare #7139. From the official ranking table we can see that the Rarity Score is 148.65 points. This means that your Mad Mutant will also receive the same exact Mutant Score after you've revealed your Mutant.</p>
        <p>However, you can boost this Rarity Score by buying and applying Upgrade Packs to your Mad Mutant. Example:</p>
        <p>Mad Mutant #7139 Mutant Score = 148.65</p>
        <p>We are going to apply 2 Upgrade packs to the mutant:</p>
        <p>1. Epic - Eyes Pack that gives you 400 additional score points. (Read <a href="https://madharesociety.com/mutants/terms-of-service" target="_blank">"Trait Packages"</a> to learn about the price of different packs)</p>
        <p>2. Common - Nose Pack that gives you 25 additional score points.</p>
        <p>Your Mad Mutant's Mutant Score is now = 148.65 + 400 + 25 = 573.65.</p>

      content: `
        <p>We've decided to honor mutant rankings based on the score derived from traits & their rarities within the collection just like with our other collections. The mutant score that will determine your position within the game rewards competition will still be calculated by the following formula:</p>
        <p>previous Mad Hare rarity score + points from applied upgrade packs = Mutant Score</p>

        <p>Yes. Few hours after the Mutation Period ends and Mutation website is shut down, weâ€™ll be taking a snapshot of holders who hold Mad Hares that were not mutated. Those holders will still receive corresponding Mad Mutants together with the rest of the people who participated in the Mutation Event. The passively created Mad Mutants will also compete for in-game rewards & receive a Mutant Score that will just equal their original Mad Hare rarity score.</p>
