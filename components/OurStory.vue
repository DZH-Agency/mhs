              It's the year 3419 in Rozkazan, known as the most notorious fortress on an ice-covered planet called Abanleor, which imprisons vicious, disturbed and dangerous modified creatures behind bars for the safety of the Milky Way Galaxy.

              Most known villains, called the Mad Hares, were captured within the last 3 centuries and placed in the darkest, most guarded rooms of the facility.
              <br>
              <br>
              Since capture, The Universal Intelligence Agency (UIA) has craved to weaponize these menaces for decades. Progress was made when the Mad Hareâ€™s focus-center of the brain called prefrontal cortex was manipulated to transform their multi-desires into a single-minded objective programmed by the UIA, but Mad Hares were never 100% controllable.

              The final test experiments resulted in a 5% kill rate of innocent subjects in test environments, down 95% from destroying everyone in their way.
              <br>
              <br>
              With the increasing tension caused by time-traveling PsychoKitties, a multi-planetary governmental voting took place to send Mad Hares after the mind-controlling felines as the last resort.
              <br>
              <br>
              A decision with as high potential consequences as releasing the Mad Hares also required universal decentralized voting to take place. With over 73,299,101 votes and 61% of population siding with the UIA mission, the Mad Hares were equipped with a time-traveling atom-weapon with a single objective in mind - to destroy the PsychoKitties.
