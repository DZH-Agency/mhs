                "Mad Hare Society" collection features 10,000 unique, algorithmically generated metaverse characters from over 245 hand-drawn traits with different levels of rarity.
                <br>
                <br>
                The rarest traits have the lowest % chance of being found among the Mad Hares and each trait has a corresponding rarity score.
                <br>
                <br>
                The sum of all the trait scores of one Mad Hare marks the total score for the character in our overall Ranking Table.
                <br>
                <br>
                Note: no two Mad Hares are exactly alike, and each one of them can be officially owned by a single person on the blockchain.
