                "Mad Hare Society" collection features 10,000 unique, algorithmically generated metaverse characters from over 245 hand-drawn traits with different levels of rarity.
                <br>
                <br>
                The rarest traits have the lowest % chance of being found among the Mad Hares and each trait has a corresponding rarity score.
                <br>
                <br>
                The sum of all the trait scores of one Mad Hare marks the total score for the character in our overall Ranking Table.
                <br>
                <br>
                Note: no two Mad Hares are exactly alike, and each one of them can be officially owned by a single person on the blockchain.

<br>
<br>
When you purchase a Mad Hare, you can earn revenue from the marketplaces that permit the use and sale of Mad Hare generally, provided that the marketplace cryptographically verifies each Mad Hare owner’s rights to display the Art for their Mad Hare.
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
You will not have right to create and sell derivatives of the Art, or distort or otherwise modify the Art or any of its parts, its colors, design, etc. or use any trademarks, brand names, logos or other intellectual property rights belonging to DaRealGenius/Mad Hare Society.
<br>
<br>
You may not, and may not allow any third party to use name, pseudonym and/or likeness of Mad Hare authors/artists, DaRealGenius/Mad Hare Society brand name, logos or other IP and assets in any kind of activities that may lead to misleading costumers or/and false association, false endorsement, etc.
